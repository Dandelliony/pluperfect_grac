It covers texts from 1816 to 1954, including various types such as fiction, news articles, and other writings. The corpus focuses on works from before the mid-20th century and contains texts by 7,590 unique authors and 44 unique translators.

It consists of copyright-free classic literature and other old texts suitable for LLM training, computational linguistics studies and education.
